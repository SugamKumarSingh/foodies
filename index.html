									<h2>FOOD WASTAGE</h2>
									<p>What is food wastage? How to reduce food wastage?</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> On a global scale, around one third of the food that is produced for human consumption is lost or wasted. And if just 25% of the world’s food loss and waste could be saved, it would be enough to feed the 821 million people that are currently going hungry around the world.</p>
								<h3>How is food wasted?</h3>
								<p>Food waste includes all food intended for human consumption that never reaches us, as well as edible food that consumers throw away.
									Perfectly edible fresh produce is often turned away from supermarket shelves because it does not meet the optimal criteria for consumers, such as shape, size and colour.
									Foods that are close to, at or beyond the “best-before” date are often discarded by retailers and consumers – even though they are still within their “use-by” date.
									Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.</p>
								<h3>What is the situation of global food wastage and hunger?</h3>
								<p>One-third of all food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tonnes) is being lost or wasted, whilst one in nine people (690 million) go hungry.
									The FAO estimates that in 2019, 2 billion people across the globe did not have access to safe, nutritious or sufficient food, while 750 million people were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity.
									If food waste were a country, it would the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, following USA and China.
									In fact, global food waste is responsible for approximately 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
									Nearly 30% of the world’s agricultural land is currently occupied to produce food that is ultimately never eaten.
									Global food loss and waste accounts for 8% of annual greenhouse gas emissions.
									Around 45% of the world’s fruit and vegetables go to waste each year.
									In developing countries 40% of food loss occurs at post-harvest and processing levels while in industrialised countries more than 40% of food loss happens at retail and consumer levels.
									Global food loss and waste costs the global economy $990 billion each year.
									There is enough food on the planet for every single person, yet 1 in 9 people go to bed hungry every night.</p>
								<h3>How to reduce food wastage?</h3>
								<p>Reducing food loss and waste is critical to creating a Zero Hunger world and reaching the world’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
									In November 2017, the Australian Government launched a National Food Waste Strategy at the National Food Waste Summit in Melbourne. The strategy provides a framework to support collective action towards halving Australia’s food waste by 2030, and aligns with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 on food loss and waste.
									Here at Foodbank, we play a vitally important role in tackling Australia’s $20 billion food waste problem.
									We work with farmers and growers, right through to retailers, to rescue and redistribute perfectly edible food to Victorians in need.
									Last year, Foodbank redirected or re-purposed 37 million kilograms of food and groceries that would otherwise end up in landfill, helping us save more than 81 million kilograms of CO2 emissions every year.</p>
